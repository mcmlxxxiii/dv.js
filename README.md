**dv.js** _(Dynamic Value)_ is a tiny library for reactive programming with javascript inspired by [the post][1] on that subject in [Silk's Engineering Blog][2].

**dv.deferred** is Deferred Object jQuery-alike implementation with _dv_.

**dv.when** is its `$.when` alike companion for joining deferreds.

Please refer to [the collection of examples][3] and [the wiki][4].

Any ideas/contributions regarding possible improvements and/or evolution of **dv.js** are very welcome!
